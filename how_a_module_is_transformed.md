### How a Module is Transformed

When Webpack processes a module, it transforms ES6 modules into CommonJS format. This transformation ensures compatibility with environments that do not natively support ES6 modules. Hereâ€™s an explanation with an example:

#### Input File:
```js
import x from './x';

export const y = function () {
  return x() + x(1);
};
```

#### Transformed File:
```js
module.exports = (module, exports, require) => {
  const x = require('./x');

  exports.y = function () {
    return x() + x(1);
  };
};
```

### Explanation of Transformation:
1. **Imports to Requires:**
   - The `import` statement is converted into a `require` function call. This allows Webpack to resolve the dependency (`'./x'`) at runtime.

2. **Exports:**
   - The `export` statement is converted into `module.exports` or `exports`. This enables the module to expose its functionality to other parts of the application.

3. **Module Wrapping:**
   - Webpack wraps each module in a function that takes three arguments:
     - `module`: Represents the module being processed.
     - `exports`: The object where exported values are attached.
     - `require`: The function used to resolve dependencies.

### Workflow Summary:
- **Input Code:** Written in ES6 or other modern JavaScript syntax.
- **Webpack Transformation:** Converts it into a CommonJS-compatible format.
- **Bundling:** The transformed modules are combined into chunks or a single bundle for browser delivery.

This transformation process ensures that even legacy environments can execute modern JavaScript code seamlessly.
